### Resetting passwords
We hope this never happens, but sometimes you lose access to your account. If you have the answer to your security question that was asked during signup, you may be able to reset your password.

### [Click here to open the Password Reset Wizard.](account/resetpass.php)
Once you have the wizard open, follow these steps:
1. Enter your username. It is case sensitive.
2. Type the answer to the security question.
3. Type a new password.
4. Log in with your new password.
